# ml-deployment
Demonstration of a deployed machine learning model using Flask. Website is https://ikera.pythonanywhere.com/. Dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/c/detecting-insults-in-social-commentary/data. The task is to detect whether a comment contains an insult or not. The deployed classifier has around 68% accuracy and is not particularly fine-tuned, since this project was done mostly to show how a machine learning model can be used inside a website. CSS and (modified) HTML is from https://github.com/MaajidKhan/DeployMLModel-Flask
